   * addToConfig() can be used to add custom persistent settings to the cfg.json file in the "um" (usermod) object.
   * It will be called by WLED when settings are actually saved (for example, LED settings are saved)
   * If you want to force saving the current state, use serializeConfig() in your loop().
   *
   * CAUTION: serializeConfig() will initiate a filesystem write operation.
   * It might cause the LEDs to stutter and will cause flash wear if called too often.
   * Use it sparingly and always in the loop, never in network callbacks!
   *
   * addToConfig() will make your settings editable through the Usermod Settings page automatically.
   *
   * Usermod Settings Overview:
   * - Numeric values are treated as floats in the browser.
   *   - If the numeric value entered into the browser contains a decimal point, it will be parsed as a C float
   *     before being returned to the Usermod.  The float data type has only 6-7 decimal digits of precision, and
   *     doubles are not supported, numbers will be rounded to the nearest float value when being parsed.
   *     The range accepted by the input field is +/- 1.175494351e-38 to +/- 3.402823466e+38.
   *   - If the numeric value entered into the browser doesn't contain a decimal point, it will be parsed as a
   *     C int32_t (range: -2147483648 to 2147483647) before being returned to the usermod.
   *     Overflows or underflows are truncated to the max/min value for an int32_t, and again truncated to the type
   *     used in the Usermod when reading the value from ArduinoJson.
   * - Pin values can be treated differently from an integer value by using the key name "pin"
   *   - "pin" can contain a single or array of integer values
   *   - On the Usermod Settings page there is simple checking for pin conflicts and warnings for special pins
   *     - Red color indicates a conflict.  Yellow color indicates a pin with a warning (e.g. an input-only pin)
   *   - Tip: use int8_t to store the pin value in the Usermod, so a -1 value (pin not set) can be used
   *
   * See usermod_v2_auto_save.h for an example that saves Flash space by reusing ArduinoJson key name strings
   *
   * If you need a dedicated settings page with custom layout for your Usermod, that takes a lot more work.
   * You will have to add the setting to the HTML, xml.cpp and set.cpp manually.
   * See the WLED Soundreactive fork (code and wiki) for reference.  https://github.com/atuline/WLED
   *
   * I highly recommend checking out the basics of ArduinoJson serialization and deserialization in order to use custom settings!
